# MP2



## Getting started
First, we need to clone this project and get into the shell package, 
make sure you have cloned the repo on all the VMs (for MP1, we need to clone code for 10 VMs)
```
git clone <gitlab_URL>
cd ./mp2/src
```
## start Servers
We can use the Server.sh to start our project
```
./Server.sh
```
Then We will see a hint read "Please input your command:"
we support three commands(ignore case):
1. "Leave" for a node leaves the group
2. "Join" for a node joins the group
3. "Print" for a node shows its membershipList

To better manipulate the server, we recommend open all the VMs in terminal, so that we can use commands on every machine.
