Log files are automatically computer-generated whenever an event with a specific classification takes place on the network. The reason log files exist is that software and hardware developers find it easier to troubleshoot and debug their creations when they access a textual record of the events that the system is producing. Each of the leading operating systems is uniquely configured to generate and categorize event logs in response to specific types of events.systems centralize all log files, to gather sort and analyze log data, and make it easy to understand, trace, and address key issues related to application performance.
The windows operating system can generate an event log in response to activity on any of its hardware or software components. Network security and operations analysts can use specialized software tools to aggregate and analyze these logs, detect patterns and trends, and respond to incidents or potential user issues. Windows is pre-configured to classify events into six categories:
an application log is created when an event takes place inside an application. These logs help code developers understand and measure how applications are behaving during development and prior to release.
a computer that is configured to respond to security authentication requests within a Windows Server domain—known as a domain controller—may generate directory service logs. These logs record user privilege changes, authentication operations, requests and other operations that take place in
a Domain Name System (DNS) server contains the databases that match hostnames of websites on the internet with their appropriate IP addresses. Each time you navigate to a new web page, DNS servers are involved in processing the request and helping your browser get to the right page. DNS server logs are a special type of log file for recording activity on a DNS server.
